# open-weather-epaper
Weather dashboard using inky impression 7color epaper display. 
This project was inspired from [this](https://github.com/kotamorishi/weather-impression) and [this](https://github.com/axwax/Open-Meteo-Inky-Pack) projects. The icon was downloaded from flaticons but feel free to use your own.

## Requirements
1) Raspberry pi (I used raspberry pi zero w but any raspberry pi will work).
2) Inky impression 7 color display.
